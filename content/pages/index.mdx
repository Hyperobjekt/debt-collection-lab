      Millions have been threatened with jail, tens of thousands have been
      summoned to court in a single county in a single . The greatest
      indignities fall on lower-income debtors and on those who are Black or
      Latinx. During the process of debt collection, individuals learn that they
      can be treated as if they have no right to respect or to redress.
