      People who already had trouble paying their bills saw those troubles
      multiply during the Covid-19 pandemic. Although there were some
      moratoriums on debt collection, thousands of lawsuits were still being
      filed in a single county court per month. We have created the Debt
      Collection Lawsuit Tracker to monitor weekly updates to the number of debt
      cases being filed across the United States.
